# TinySecurity

TinySecurity supplies security policy through a native TinyBus module. Hosts
compile the transport-free `tinysecurity-bus` contract and load the isolated
`tinysecurity-module` artifact. The bootstrap implements `Evaluate`, batched
`Check`, `PolicyInfo`, validated SDK configuration and policy generations.
Contract 1.23 adds confidential per-frame `DeviceFrame2` calls over the live
opaque tunnel capability issued by approved `ExecuteDevice2` work; see the
[device contract](MODULE.md#confidential-device-handles).
Contract 1.25 adds `DevicePairing2`, which owns the paired-device static
identity, ciphertext-only persistence, host-attested enrollment/reconnect,
session refresh and revocation while preserving the existing v2/v3/v4 wire;
see the [pairing lifecycle specification](docs/specs/device-pairing-contract-1.25.md).
Contract 1.1 also supplies immutable native [filesystem scopes](docs/specs/immutable-path-scopes.md)
through `RegisterPathPolicy`, `ValidatePath`, `ValidateParent` and `CheckPath`.
Contract 1.3 adds native `Redact`, `ScanPrompt` and `ScanToolDefinition`, with a
validated initialization-only literal registry and [bounded surface modes](crates/tinysecurity-redact/README.md).
Blocked original content denies; suspicious content denies with
approval-unavailable in unbound policy methods. Scan verdicts
never grant permission, and redaction never clears an existing scan finding.

Contract 1.22 adds policy and egress gap members: `CheckPaths2` (batch path checks), `ProtectedPath2` and `ProtectedFloor2` (the unconditional lexical floor and its vocabulary), `SpendAction2` and `PeekBudget2` (the hourly action ledger outside the harness), `ClassifyHostAction2` (the informational class of a host tool) and `PrivacyCheck2` (a descriptor-level privacy decision) (see [MODULE.md](MODULE.md#policy-and-egress-gap-members-contract-122)). Contract 1.22 adds `SandboxPlanRequest2.options` (an executor preference, a workspace-less plan and the operator's planned run on the host, never for `SaaS` or an untrusted source) and the artifact flags `host_run` and `no_workspace` (see [MODULE.md](MODULE.md#executor-choice-workspace-less-plans-and-the-operators-host-run-contract-122)). Contract 1.22 also adds the approval origin classes `TrustedAutomation`, `LocalOperator` and `Unlabelled`, durable flow trust (`GrantFlowTool2`, `RevokeFlowTool2`, `ListFlowTrust2`) and scored prompt screening (`ScanPrompt2`) (see [MODULE.md](MODULE.md#approval-origin-classes-durable-flow-trust-and-scored-prompt-screening-contract-122)). Contract 1.21 adds `RecordAudit2` and `AuditKind2::PolicyDecision`, so the host appends execution and no-prompt policy-decision events to a real subject's audit stream (see [MODULE.md](MODULE.md#host-recorded-audit-events-contract-121)), `SandboxScope2.operator_host_network` (host network granted by the owner's configuration, never under `SaaS`) and `SandboxPlanRequest2.accept_process_isolation` (a best-effort process jail may run an ordinary operator command, never untrusted code) (see [MODULE.md](MODULE.md#operator-host-network-and-process-level-jails-contract-121)). Contract 1.20 adds host-tool admission: `Check::HostAction` judges a host tool by its permission level, the caller's tier and origin and a registered command scope's autonomy and hourly budget; `Check::HostShell` gates a shell command under that scope's class gate, hidden-execution defence and budget without reserving an action. Refusals are typed (`read_only_mode`, `rate_limited`, `scheduled_read_only`, `high_risk`) (see [MODULE.md](MODULE.md#host-tool-admission-contract-120)). Contract 1.19 adds runtime sandbox scopes (`RegisterSandboxScope2`, `RetireSandboxScope2`), so a host that serves unbounded subjects can plan sandboxes per subject (see [MODULE.md](MODULE.md#runtime-sandbox-scopes-contract-119)). Contract 1.18 returns the sanitized subject handle in `ApprovalScopeReceipt2` and keeps the path, command and egress members available when approvals are configured (see [MODULE.md](MODULE.md#subject-handles-and-unbound-members-contract-118)). Contract 1.17 adds runtime approval scopes (`RegisterApprovalScope2`, `ReplaceApprovalScope2`, `RetireApprovalScope2`), tool and flow grants, and `Check::HostTool` (see [MODULE.md](MODULE.md#runtime-approval-scopes-and-host-tools-contract-117)). Contract 1.16 adds `RedactWith`, redaction with exact credentials supplied for one call (see [MODULE.md](MODULE.md#per-call-exact-credentials-redactwith-contract-116)). Contract 1.15 adds `RedactMode::CredentialsOnly` and the `EgressPolicy` fields `open_public` and `preflight_transports` (see [MODULE.md](MODULE.md#credentials-only-redaction-and-open-public-egress-contract-115)). Contract 1.14 adds confidential `PasswordCrypt2`, `KeyringAccess2` and `PairingControl2` (see [MODULE.md](MODULE.md)). Contract 1.13 added `EvaluateScopedAudited` and `CheckScopedAudited` for registered policies under required audit (see [`docs/specs/scoped-policies.md`](docs/specs/scoped-policies.md)).

Contract 1.26 adds durable whole-tool trust (`GrantTool2`, `RevokeTool2` and
`ListToolTrust2`), persisted and audited through the approval store. See the
[whole-tool trust spec](docs/specs/durable-tool-trust.md). The private
`ImportTrustSource2` host member adds import-once receipts for legacy whole-tool
and flow-tool grants, retained after revocation so partial migration retries cannot
restore removed authority.
Contract 1.27 adds `RevokeToolById2`, allowing a host to revoke a listed grant by
its opaque row identity when the display label is redacted.
Contract 1.28 adds `AuthorizeBrowserDial`, `ConsumeBrowserDial`, and
`ValidateBrowserDial` for session-bound, destination-only authorization of
opaque browser sockets. It vets every resolved address, issues a one-use grant
for an exact socket, and requires transports to close CONNECT/WebSocket streams
when a lease expires or policy generation changes. Sensitive and local-only
privacy modes deny this uninspectable traffic; TinyComputer remains responsible
for enforcing the proxy and dialing the approved socket. See the
[browser-dial contract specification](docs/specs/browser-dial-contract-1.28.md).

Contract 1.6 supplies `Audit2`, `EvaluateAudited2` and `CheckAudited2` with
authenticated exact audit callbacks and a bounded [native journal](crates/tinysecurity-audit/README.md).
The audited permission methods derive events from the actual original request,
computed decision and current generation. Required audit disables unbound
`Evaluate`/`Check` permission and other unbound path/command/egress authorization;
exact durable evidence precedes an audited allow. Scope registration and
descriptive classification remain available.
Windows local journals require an externally preprovisioned, protected NTFS
namespace and preexisting restricted authority; see the native journal contract.

The engine denies unknown tools and unsupported effects. Argument-free `pwd`,
`date`, `uname`, and `whoami` are its supported shell diagnostics. Paths pass
an unconditional credential/system/traversal floor and native ancestor
resolution; enabled policy adds action-root, workspace and forbidden-root
checks. Enabled writes require the durable approval surface. Pure local
diagnostics work with disabled autonomy, which is the default.

This is bootstrap infrastructure for [OpenHuman #7328](https://github.com/tinyhumansai/openhuman/issues/7328)
and [TinySecurity #1](https://github.com/tinyhumansai/tinysecurity/issues/1).
It does **not** complete the migration. Concrete sandbox spawning, connection pinning, Linux Secret Service and production host configuration/adapter migration remain unavailable. Contract 1.25 supplies the module-owned pairing and tunnel lifecycle; the host must provide the server-trusted controller/socket/reconnect callbacks and encrypted persistence plumbing described in its specification. The optional [native device handle surface](MODULE.md#confidential-device-handles) uses authenticated confidential calls; initial master unlock remains HumanOnly. Reserved wire types do not advertise callable handlers.
There is no production host migration until an upstream release and checksum
manifest exist.

Contract 1.7 adds [durable exact approvals](crates/tinysecurity-approval/README.md)
with authenticated store/CAS, delivery and human-ticket callbacks. Approval
configuration disables older permission shortcuts. Pending rows and audits
precede prompts; exact original-call bindings and CAS reservations govern execution.

Contract 1.8 enables optional [native Jev scoring](crates/tinysecurity-auto/README.md)
through explicit endpoint/key initialization and per-origin opt-in. Redacted
scores meet local thresholds before durable `auto:jev` one-shot approval;
all uncertain/error/budget paths keep the authenticated human flow. Required
CAS/audit receipts and fresh policy floors still gate permission.

Contract 1.10 adds [confidential injected master resolution](docs/module-crypto.md#confidential-injected-master-resolution) with opaque native aliases. Configured-secret reinit is conservatively denied pending a coherent owner transaction. This is an injected-store prerequisite, not production keyring or password migration.

Contract 1.9 adds [scoped declarative sandbox planning](crates/tinysecurity-sandbox/README.md).
`Plan2` uses immutable host-registered source provenance, ceilings and executor
capability declarations. Exact committed audit precedes activation of an opaque
artifact; `ConsumeSandboxPlan2` reserves that artifact once. Host networking
requires an exact authenticated human Once decision through
`EvaluateSandboxApproval2`, even when generic automatic approvals are enabled.
These ports do not prove OS confinement or launch a child: TinyBox must enforce
and revalidate the plan at the actual execution boundary.

## Validation

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo build --all-targets --all-features
cargo test --all-features
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --no-deps --all-features
cargo run -p tinysecurity-module --example verify_module -- target/debug/libtinysecurity_module.so
cargo run -p tinysecurity-module --example judge_native_contract -- target/debug/libtinysecurity_module.so
```

Use `.dylib` on macOS and `tinysecurity_module.dll` on Windows. The loader
example proves allow/deny, malformed/unsupported invocation rejection,
reconfiguration retention and generation, then prints real bus latency.

See [module boundary](MODULE.md), [confidential crypto members](docs/module-crypto.md),
[registered subject policies](docs/module-subject-policies.md), [accepted specification](docs/specs/security-module.md),
[implementation sequence](docs/plans/security-module.md), and [roadmap](ROADMAP.md).

`ConsumeSandboxPlan2` carries the original typed `Plan2` envelope as well as the
opaque artifact. The host derives that envelope from the exact prepared spawn:
argv, environment, cwd and input belong in its bounded original operation.
The owner validates its canonical binding before audit and again after the
callback; changed operations cannot consume a copied artifact. This does not
replace TinyBox's live isolation and capability checks.
